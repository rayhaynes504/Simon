- Need random number from 1-4
- Need an array to push random numbers into. 
- Random number will correspond to which box should light up. 
- Need a way to check if user input is the same as the array
- Need a way to initialize the game 
- Need to make a big pause so the user can put in their input without code running (a button would work)
- Need to make a simple animation so the user can confirm they have clicked the intended square
